.DD 12/08/2022

.SH NAME
.B simple shell
\
- simple UNIX command interpreter 

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple shell\fR [\fIfilename\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Our
.B simple shell
was modeled after the
.B Bourne shell 
(/bin/sh). The simple shell's purpose is to read commands from either a terminal (standard input) or a file, and execute them just as the 
.B Bourne shell 
would.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
Upon invocation, our
.B simple shell
Receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed. This
.B environment
is an array of
.I name-value
strings describing variables in the format
.I NAME=VALUE
. 

.SH PARAMETERS
A 
.I parameter
is an entity that stores values. It can be a 
.I name
, a number, or one of the special characters listed below.
.PP 
The following
.I parameters
are automatically set by the shell.
.IP #
The number of positional parameters
.IP -
Options supplied to the shell on invocation
.IP ?
The value returned by the last executed command
.IP $
The process number of this shell
.IP !
The process number of the last background command invoked
.IP c
Print a character.
.PP 
The following
.I parameters
are used but not set by the shell.
.IP HOME
The default argument (home directory) for the
.B cd
command
.IP PATH
The search path for commands
.IP MAIL
If this variable is set to the name of a mail file then the shell informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon success, the
.B simple shell
will return the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs.

.SH EXAMPLE
To enter the
.B simple shell
, one would run the
.I executable file
in the terminal. From there, one is able to run basic
.I shell commands
such as the following:
.IP
$ ls
.IP
main     man_1_ simple_shell     README.md     AUTHORS     main.c     shell.h
